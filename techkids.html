                                <p class="card-text pt-2" style="font-size: 15px;">Being a part of techkids is itself only a pro thing. I took part in both automobile workshop and winter internship, it was awesome to be there. My mentor in both sessions was Shashank H P. It was almost a bliss to have him as a mentor, be it the teaching or hand in experience, he did the best. The sessions were best, he used to tell us everything regarding subject and dealing with issues which may occur in learning it. The best part was that we weren't feeling it as a class, but as a discussion between friends about a topic and he made us feel that way.
                                  In automobile workshop, we had a typical internship feel. For explanation, he would bring all the parts, we were supposed to see it and make reports of it. In the end we had a great hand in experience day at automobile workshop. On that day we disembeled engine parts and re arranged it in same way. He told his experience and that inspired us to do something out of the box. He told us ways about how can we shape our future according to our needs and deeds. 
                                  The next session was about coding. He knew about our situation as fresher, for me personally, I didn't know anything about coding. So he taught us about everything from the scratch. From no knowledge about coding to do a project based on coding was a great success for us. He was all supportive all along. He gave us a great tool kit and greater knowledge. The first day started with an open Introduction of ourselves in a fun way, so that we feel comfortable. From coding to bug solving to soldering to product design he made us do it all. We even did field trip for our project in a blind school, the confidence we gained were visible. He also told ways to interact using linkedin and made it sorted for us. It may feel as I amexagerrating, but it is what it is, he made it easy for engineering and after. I wish I had got  more time with techkids and this amazing caring mentor Shashank anna. Even admist of his busy life he made time to help others, it's so great of him. At the end of internship he made sure that we present our projects in front of faculty, so that we get 100% of it. And it all went well. And I must say 90% of the confidence I have today is because of workshops. Thank you so much anna for everything!!..</p>

Side by side it was fun too. Each day we were getting  new things to learn and use. Even though we were dealing with very new concepts wrt us,we didn't feel any difficulty in learning it. And all the credit goes to our mentor Shashank HP.  The whole intership was like a mission. Our mentor helped us to overcome our fears and made it as our plus points . He wasn't leaving any stones untouched. He would put us to do all things we were supposed to do in future days. For someone who didn't know how to coding,doing a whole new project was unbelievable.  He made sure that we do it with all our hearts. His tutoring was so simple, even beginners can get it all. He gave personal space for each one of us to learn at our own phase. Daily reports, hand in experience, the data  collection  solving the problem statement, logically thinking of a sustainable solution, discussions,amendment of our project plan,coding and finally presentation.  It was huge and he made it feel so easy. He was there until end and we couldn't thank him enough.  As a person too, he was very friendly and caring ,he didn't judge us even if we lack at doing something, inspite of it he taught us more . He used to guide us about everything be it academics or anything else. He was there all along. Even if we can accomplish half of the things we have got to learn in this internship. It's worth it. Finally I want to thank shashank anna for all things  he has given us. Even in his final year of engineering, he sought a way to show some light to fellow juniors. I did a project on smart blind stick in my second workshop with his guidance. Thank u anna for everything. </p>

The intership was very welly organised by offering separate class and by providing basic equipment for that intership , shashank anna thought us very well from basic not only robotics and iot. there are many special classes also organised like class on soldering, ppt presentation etc which are very useful and the way that intership carried by shashank anna is very appreciable and shashank anna also organised a presentation ceremony where we show cased our developed project to many lecturers of maland college. At last we recieved a certificate for our intership .

                            Overall it was a fantastic experience to learn from shashank anna
