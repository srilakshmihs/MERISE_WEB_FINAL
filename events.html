The resource person-prof. V. B. Nanda Gopal (chief-executive, Centre for Start-up, Innovation and Incubation, STEP, JSS Academy of technical education, Bangalore.) is an expert in this field. He came up with an idea on entrepreneurship team in MCE and rechristened STEP to MERIISE (Malnad Enclave, Research, Innovation, Incubation, Start-up and entrepreneurship). He addressed the students and faculties about emphasizing the need to nurture innovative ideas of young minds and convert these ideas into a successful business to respond to the emerging needs of the society.

When an idea or a problem occurs, experts, professionals, and specialists with technical backgrounds all collaborate towards devising a unique strategy or a solution. When great young minds work together, it’s almost like miracles truly happen.</p>
										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">	Learnathon and Supercoders was the first lavish event organized by MERIISE. This mega event was held for a duration of 48 hours and was the first overnight hackathon oversee in MCE. Colossal students all over the state were enthusiastic to participate in this state level event. Learnathon is a beneficial platform for the young minds to learn basic of Java, C and SQL and start coding on problems. The participants who were able to understand would knack the problem with their creativity in less time. In next level supercoders, the participants will be given the technical problem to code and as a result an extraordinary and unique solution is obtained. The experts Mr. Krishnanand S M, Mr.Akshay Hegde and Mr. Shashidharan from Amphisoft technologies guided the participants. This becomes beneficial for young minds to learn the application of solving current industry-oriented problems. The knowledge acquired by students will be helpful in their future and efforts of coordinators made the event extra ordinary and successful.

										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">What is big data?  Why is big data?</p>
										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">Big Data is a field that treats ways to analyse, systematically extract information from, or otherwise deal with data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many cases(rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity(more attributes or columns)may lead to higher false discovery rate.</p>
										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">	Without big data analytics, most of the organisations would become similar to a wayfarer, who doesn't know what to do or where to go completely lost in the world of data. Big data is like a compass to the wanderer.</p>
										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">	With knowing all this advantages of big data, “PRAGYATHA” provided a great opportunity for interested candidates from all over the state who were eager to learn the basics of  “Big Data” analytics.</p>
										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">Numerous participants from all over the state were gathered to harness the knowledge from the workshop which lasted for two consecutive days during “PRAGYATHA”.</p>
										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">The participants were monitored by a very resourceful person named Dr. Pramod Kumar Naik, who has been working as a Senior manager for Technical and skill development division at "AGIMUS Technologies Pvt. Ltd" and “RV Skills”, Bangalore, guided the participants in developing the technical skills on Big Data.</p>
										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">It was indeed a promising workshop with positive feedback from all the participants.

										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">This event was mainly about creating a platform to the students with astonishing ideas about the start-ups that would be helping the industries to enhance their level.</p>
										<p style="padding-left: 30px;padding-right: 10px">Seed grant was divided into two phases. Whereas in the first phase many passionate students came up with pretty interesting ways to overcome the same problem statement they were given with. The participants were instructed to explain their ideas to the panel of our juries which included Mr. Johnson Tellis , chief executive officer at Technical career education and also the director of Sahyadri hub for Innovations and Entrepreneurship and also various other contributors from different places acrosss the state, through video conference.</p>
